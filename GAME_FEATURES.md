### Technical Implementation

#### Fixed Game Flow
```
Initial State: Ball paused, IsBallPaused = true, CanStartGame() = true
?
First Click: Ball launches, IsGameStarted = true, IsBallPaused = false
?
During Play: Ball physics active, both paddles responsive
?
Point Scored: Ball resets, IsBallPaused = true, paddles STAY ACTIVE
?
Next Click: CanStartGame() = true, ball relaunches, continuous gameplay
```

#### New State Management
- **IsGameRunning** - Controls ball physics and collisions
- **IsGameStarted** - Controls paddle responsiveness
- **IsBallPaused** - Tracks ball pause state after scoring
- **CanStartGame()** - Determines if click should start/restart game

#### UI Layout Changes
